# Meat Billing POS Frontend

Expo React Native client for the Billing System. The app supports:

- first admin registration on fresh installs
- shared login flow for admin and shop users
- admin dashboard for shops, sales, payments, bills, and audit logs
- shop bootstrap flow with required daily price setup
- counter billing cart and exact-payment checkout
- receipt preview after a settled backend response
- Android Bluetooth and USB ESC/POS receipt printing with saved printer setup

## Stack

- Expo 54
- React Native with TypeScript
- React Navigation
- Zustand
- React Hook Form
- NativeWind
- Axios
- @haroldtran/react-native-thermal-printer

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `18+`
- npm
- Running backend API on port `8000` or another reachable URL
- Android emulator, iOS simulator, or browser
- Android development build for Bluetooth and USB receipt printing

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

Create a local env file before running the app or taking a build:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the backend URL:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.example.com
```

## Native Printer Build

Bluetooth and USB receipt printing use a native React Native printer module, so Expo Go cannot run the full POS printing workflow. Expo Go can open the app UI and use the system print fallback, but it cannot discover or connect ESC/POS Bluetooth or USB printers.

Use an Android development build for real POS printer testing:

```bash
cd "/home/sachinn-p/Codes/Billing System/frontend"
npm run doctor:android
npm run android:dev
npm run start:dev -- --clear
```

If `npm run doctor:android` reports missing `kvm group access` on Linux, run this once, then fully log out and log back in:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```

After the dev build is installed, scan the `exp+meat-billing-pos://...` QR code with that development build, not Expo Go.

## Run

### Expo Go

```bash
npm run start
```

Or:

```bash
npx expo start --go
```

Use Expo Go when you want to test the shared UI flow without direct Bluetooth or USB printer access.

### Android Emulator

```bash
npx expo start --android
```

Backend target comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

### Android Development Build For POS Printing

```bash
npm run doctor:android
npm run android:dev
npm run start:android
```

Use this path when you need Bluetooth or USB printer discovery and direct receipt printing.

### iOS Simulator

```bash
npx expo start --ios
```

Backend target comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

### Local Web

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Backend target comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

### Physical Device On The Same Wi-Fi

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.20:8000 npx expo start --lan
```

Replace `192.168.1.20` with your computer's LAN IP.

### Physical Device Through Expo Tunnel

Expo tunnel mode does not expose the backend. Start Expo with a public backend URL:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-tunnel.example.com npx expo start --tunnel
```

## API Base URL Logic

The frontend resolves the API host from `src/constants/config.ts`.

- If `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set, that value is used.
- If `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is missing, API requests are blocked and the app shows a configuration error.
- The value may come from the local `.env` file or from Expo/EAS app config at build time.
- Expo tunnel hosts are intentionally not treated as backend hosts.

Current local `.env` example:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com
```

## App Flow

### Auth

- `Login` screen supports both admin and shop sign-in.
- `Create Admin` works only until the first admin already exists in the backend.
- Auth state is persisted locally and restored on app launch.

### Admin Experience

- create shop accounts
- view shop status and enable or disable access
- monitor total sales, cash totals, and UPI totals
- inspect recent bills
- inspect audit logs

### Shop Experience

- fetch shop bootstrap data after login
- set or update today's prices for every active item
- add items to the cart using kg or unit rules
- save one Bluetooth or USB receipt printer per POS device from the printer setup screen
- split payment between cash and UPI
- complete checkout only when payment exactly matches the total
- preview receipt text after a successful bill
- print directly to the saved Bluetooth or USB thermal printer on Android
- fall back to system print on web and iOS

## Scripts

```bash
npm run start
npm run start:go
npm run start:dev
npm run start:android
npm run android
npm run android:dev
npm run ios
npm run web
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## EAS Build

This project includes [eas.json](./eas.json) with these profiles:

- `development`: dev client build for local development
- `preview`: internal Android APK build for direct install and testing
- `production`: Android AAB build for Play Store submission

### One-time setup

```bash
cd "/home/sachinn-p/Codes/Billing System/frontend"
npx eas-cli@latest login --browser
npx eas-cli@latest build:configure
```

`build:configure` links the app to your Expo project and may add the EAS project id to your app config if it is missing.

If your Expo account uses Google OAuth, use browser login and choose `Continue with Google`. The terminal password prompt will fail for Google-only sign-in:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest login --browser
npx eas-cli@latest whoami
```

### Set env values for cloud builds

Local `.env` files are gitignored, so EAS cloud builds should use EAS environment variables instead of relying on the local file.

Current API base URL for this project:

```text
https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com
```

Preview build env:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL --value https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com --environment preview --visibility plaintext
```

Production build env:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL --value https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com --environment production --visibility plaintext
```

If you want your local `.env` to match an EAS environment later:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest env:pull --environment development
```

### Build commands

Installable Android APK:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build -p android --profile preview
```

Play Store Android AAB:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build -p android --profile production
```

After the preview build finishes, you can install it with:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build:run -p android --latest
```

### Full command sequence for this project

Preview APK:

```bash
cd "/home/sachinn-p/Codes/Billing System/frontend"
npx eas-cli@latest whoami
npx eas-cli@latest env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL --value https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com --environment preview --visibility plaintext
npm run eas:android:preview
```

Production AAB:

```bash
cd "/home/sachinn-p/Codes/Billing System/frontend"
npx eas-cli@latest whoami
npx eas-cli@latest env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL --value https://mahalakshmi-pos.onrender.com --environment production --visibility plaintext
npm run eas:android:production
```

## Printer Workflow

1. Open `Set Up Printer` from the billing screen or `Manage Printer` from the receipt screen.
2. Refresh Bluetooth printers if the device is already linked in Android Bluetooth settings.
3. Refresh USB printers after plugging the thermal printer into the device with OTG support.
4. Connect one printer and save it on the device.
5. Run `Print Test Slip` to confirm the printer is ready.
6. Complete a bill and use `Print To Saved Printer` on the receipt screen.

## Notes

- The app uses a single navigator that switches between auth, admin, and shop flows based on the stored session.
- If today's price sheet is missing, shop users are redirected to the daily price screen before billing.
- Changing today's prices from the billing screen clears the current cart to keep prices consistent for the next bill.
- Bluetooth permissions are declared in `app.config.js` and requested at runtime on Android.
- Expo Go cannot use the printer feature because the printer library requires custom native code.
- If printer support is unavailable, the receipt screen still exposes the existing system-print fallback.
